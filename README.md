# Reducer_Blogpost_ReactNative_Online
This is the second version of Blog Post (Reducer_Blogpost_ReactNative )react native app which implements services to handle blog posts. This project is using jsonserver to save and retrieve blogposts.So please install json server (server code is placed inside the project itself) before running the app. Also I am using grok to make the local IP address accessible from outside machines.Please start ngrok as well and replace the base URL in 'jsonServer.js' file in the project with the public URL from 'ngrok'
